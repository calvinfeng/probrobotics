# Probabilistic Robotics

I am not going to cover every chapter of the book. I just need to handpick
couple important chapters to go over the core concepts of localization.

## Part 1

- [ ] Recursive State Estimation
- [ ] Gaussian Filters
- [ ] Nonparametric Filters
- [ ] Robot Perception

## Part 2

- [ ] Mobile Robot Localization: Markov & Gaussian
- [ ] Mobile Robot Localization: Grid & Monte Carlo
